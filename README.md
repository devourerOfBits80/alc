# alc (Arch Linux constructor)

*alc* is a set of *[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)* playbooks meant to make a post-installation process for the fresh installed *[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org)* operating system. If you want to make a base installation of the *Arch Linux* OS in a pretty fast and easy way, you can just use the attached [INSTALLATION GUIDE](https://github.com/devourerOfBits80/alc/blob/master/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md).
